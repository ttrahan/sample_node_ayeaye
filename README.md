A simple Node.js application with tests.<br/>

Different branches demonstrate different use cases, as follows:

**master:**
This branch changes frequently for demos, as needed, but typically shows: 
  * CI run that builds and pushes a Docker image to a Docker registry (Docker Hub, Quay.io, Amazon ECR, Google Container Registry, etc.) 
  * Auto-generate an updated deployment manifest 
  * Auto-deploy to a Test environment (e.g. Amazon ECS, Docker Datacenter, Triton, etc.) 
  * Manual trigger to create a release candidate for Prod environment 
  * Manual deploy to Prod environment

**amazon-ecs:**
* CI run that builds and pushes a Docker image to Amazon EC/2 Container Registry (ECR) 
* Auto-generate an updated deployment manifest 
* Auto-deploy to a Test environment in Amazon EC/2 Container Service (ECS)   
  * Deployed containers will automatically register listeners with AWS Application Load Balancer 
* Manual trigger to create a release candidate for Prod environment 
* Manual deploy to Prod environment in Amazon ECS   
  * Deployed containers will automatically register listeners with AWS Application Load Balancer |

**gke:**
* CI run that builds and pushes a Docker image to Google Container Registry 
* Auto-generate an updated deployment manifest 
* Auto-deploy to a Test environment in Google Container Engine (GKE) 
* Manual trigger to create a release candidate for Prod environment 
* Manual deploy to Prod environment in GKE                                                                                                 

**triton:**  
* CI run that builds and pushes a Docker image to Docker Hub
* Note that the app uses the Container Pilot pattern with Consul for Service Discovery
* Auto-generate an updated deployment manifest
* Auto-deploy to a Test environment in Joyent Triton 
* Manual trigger to create a release candidate for Prod environment 
* Manual deploy to Prod environment in Joyent Triton                                                                                                                                                      |
